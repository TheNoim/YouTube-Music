# YouTube-Music

# Note: I will probably never update this player again. It never reached the beta status. If you want to update it, make a pull request.

There is no good youtube player for music, this is why I did this :D  
At the moment this player is highly experimental and you need to start it over the terminal or cmd.

## But Noim how can I use this absolute awesome player ?
Ok ok. First you need to have installed node js (https://nodejs.org/ v7.5.0 or greater) 
After you installed node js you need to install git.  
If you have a mac you cann install it via brew. If you have not installed brew, just go to http://brew.sh/  
Now you can install git via terminal with  
`brew install git`  
In the case you have windows (poor boy) go to https://git-scm.com/ and install it.
Now you need to open a cmd or the terminal.
Then type:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheNoim/YouTube-Music
cd YouTube-Music
npm install
npm install bower -g
npm install electron -g
bower install
```
You can start it now with:  
`electron .`

## But what when I just want to use this awesome Player without typing these cryptographic commands?

Just take a look to the releases Page: [releases](https://github.com/TheNoim/YouTube-Music/releases "Releases Page")
There you should find an executable file for your OS!
